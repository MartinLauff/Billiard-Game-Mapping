## Billiard Game Mapping

The repository holds all processes used for detecting/classifying billiard balls and segmentation of the surface play area of a table.

It contains Jupyter notebooks for:

1. Dataset Preprocessing.
2. YOLO detection/segmentation model training.
3. Mapping of billiard balls from image to numerical form via Homography.
